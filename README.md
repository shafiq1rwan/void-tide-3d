# VOID TIDE

*You are a lighthouse keeper on a lonely island in a dark sea. Creatures of the void tide surface offshore, swim for your island, crawl onto the beach, and lay siege to the beacon at its heart.*

**Survive 10 tides and dawn breaks. Lose the beacon — or the keeper — and the tide claims all.**

A first-person shooter built with [three.js](https://threejs.org) in a **single HTML file**. Every asset is procedural low-poly geometry — no models, no textures, no sounds files, no network requests. Open `index.html` and play.

## How to Play

Defend the lighthouse beacon at the center of the island. Creatures swim in from the dark sea each tide and will attack the beacon — or you, if you get close or shoot them. Clear all 10 tides to win. Between tides your ammo reserve is restocked and the beacon slowly repairs.

Watch the minimap: white flashing dots are incoming voidspawn, and glowing eyes in the water mark swimmers closing in. Enemies sometimes drop glowing pickups — cyan for ammo, red for health.

### Controls

| `II` button | Pause |

### The Tide

| Creature | Appears | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Snapper** | Tide 1 | Steady crawler, heads for the beacon |
| **Lurker** | Tide 2 | Fast and fragile, hunts the keeper |
| **Spitter** | Tide 3 | Ranged — lobs void bile from a distance |
| **Brute** | Tide 4+ | Slow, heavily armored, devastating against the beacon |

Enemies get tougher each tide. Your shield regenerates out of combat; your health only recovers from pickups.

## Running It

No build step, no server, no internet required — three.js is inlined into the file, so it works fully offline and behind corporate firewalls that block CDNs.

- **Locally:** double-click `index.html`.
- **GitHub Pages:** push to GitHub, then enable Pages (Settings → Pages → deploy from branch, root folder). The game will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
- **Install as an app (PWA):** when hosted on Pages, open the game in a mobile browser and choose *Add to Home Screen* / *Install app*. The installed app launches truly fullscreen in landscape and works offline (`manifest.webmanifest` + `sw.js` + icons).

If the start button ever does nothing, click it again — a diagnostic panel will appear on the menu explaining what failed (usually WebGL/hardware acceleration disabled in the browser).

## Tech Notes

- **Single file:** ~720 KB total, including all game code and an inlined copy of three.js r160 (MIT License, © three.js authors).
- **Procedural everything:** terrain with vertex-colored flat shading, animated sea, lighthouse with a rotating volumetric beam, creatures, first-person rifle viewmodel — all built from primitive geometry at load time. Audio (gunfire, roars, sea ambience, void drone) is synthesized live with the Web Audio API.
- **Mobile:** touch joystick + aim drag, fullscreen with landscape orientation lock, reduced pixel ratio and shadows disabled for performance.
